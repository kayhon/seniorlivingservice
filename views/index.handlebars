            <p class="text-muted">Once we speak with you to determine your current situation, preferences, timeline, and budget, we begin to research senior living options that fit your needs. We first begin by checking the States records on how well a particular community is doing and what the past track records look like. From there, we preview the community and learn more about the details that matter the most.</p>

"I just wanted to send you our sincere thanks for all that you did in the last 2 weeks for my Mom and for her appropriate placement in Poway.

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">For an older adult, the choice between assisted living and independent living usually depends on how well an individual can manage daily activities without extra assistance.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/indep.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>Independent Living Communities vary in size, capacity, and general look-and-feel. They can be quaint, cozy communities or palatial estates. This type of community provides the least amount of care. However, you can hire in-home care within a retirement community.

Independent living is for elders who may not be safe living at home, may not be safe driving, may be living in an unsafe neighborhood, or may need minor assistance daily.<br>

Independent Living offers:<br>

•Meal plans<br>

•Transportation<br>

•Laundry<br>

•Housekeeping<br>

•Home and yard maintenance<br>

•Safe community<br>

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">Assisted Living</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Housing for the elderly or disabled that provides nursing care including medication, housekeeping, and prepared meals as needed.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/assist.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>What is Assisted Living?

Assisted living facilities come in all shapes, sizes and neighborhoods. Based on the varied preferences and needs of the elderly there are a variety of settings from which to choose. These choices range from high-rise buildings to one-story Victorian mansions to large multi-acre campuses. Assisted living facilities are also located in single-family homes and duplexes referred to as residential care facilities.

The philosophy of assisted living is to provide personalized, resident centered care in order to meet individual preferences and needs. Assisted living is designed for individuals who require assistance with everyday activities such as meals, medication management or assistance, bathing, dressing and transportation. Some residents may have memory disorders including Alzheimer’s, or they may need help with mobility, incontinence or other challenges. Assisted living treats all residents with dignity, provides privacy and encourages independence and freedom of choice. Resident family members and friends are encouraged to get involved in the assisted living community.

Typical Services Offered in Assisted Living Communities/

Amenities in assisted living typically include:<br>

•Three meals a day served in a common dining area<br>

•Housekeeping services<br>

•Transportation<br>

•24-hour security<br>

•Exercise and wellness programs<br>

•Personal laundry services<br>

•Social and recreational activities<br>

Personal care in assisted living typically includes:<br>

•Staff available to respond to both scheduled and unscheduled needs<br>

•Assistance with eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and walking<br>

•Access to health and medical services, such as physical therapy and hospice<br>

•Emergency call systems for each resident’s apartment<br>

•Medication management<br>

•Care for residents with cognitive impairments<br>

Independence is always encouraged through an individualized plan of personal care and wellness. As well, some communities are pet-friendly and on approval may move in with their dog or cat.<br>

What is the Cost of Assisted Living?<br>

Assisted living costs vary with the residence, apartment size, and types of services needed. The basic rate may cover all services or there may be additional charges for special services. Most assisted living residences charge on a month-to-month lease arrangement, but a few require long-term arrangements. Assisted living is often less expensive than home health or nursing home care in the same geographical area. The average monthly cost to live in an assisted living facility is $3300.00 per month.<br>

While 86.2% of assisted living residents today pay for long-term care from their personal financial resources, 41 states offer “home and community-based waivers” that allow low-income residents to live in assisted living facilities. More seniors are purchasing long-term care insurance to help plan for and finance their long-term care needs.<br>
